# KDD Cup Classification using ANN
## I. Outline
- A network intrusion refers to any unauthorized activity on a digital network. 
- Network intrusions often involve stealing valuable network resources and almost always jeopardize the security of networks and/or their data.
- In this project, we aim to build a model that can classify normal/ abnormal connection.
## II. Business Objective/ Problem
- Assume that you work in the Data Science department of a company that provides telecommunications services. Your task is to detect "bad" connections among everyday connections.
- Your client is suspected of having "bad" connections that could steal user information. They ask you to build a model to help them detect "bad" connections to promptly prevent and avoid loss of user data.
- This project is made based on that requirement.
## III. Project implementation
### 1. Business Understanding
Based on the above description => identify the problem:
- Find methods to classify "bad" connection among normal connections.
- Objectives/problems: build a classification model to classify these 2 connection types.
- Applied method: ANN model
### 2. Data Understanding/ Acquire
- Data is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/KDD+Cup+1999+Data
- There are 2 files to build model:
  - kddcup.data.gz: train and test your model by data in this file
  - kddcup.testdata.unlabeled.gz: predict new value in this file
